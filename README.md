# FirstLook-SQLBasics
This repository provides the sample data and loader program that you will need to work through the demos in <a href="http://docs.intersystems.com/irislatest/csp/docbook/DocBook.UI.Page.cls?KEY=AFL_sqlbasics">First Look: SQL and InterSystems IRIS</a>.

Files in this sample include:

<ul>
	<li>Loader.xml: a class written in InterSystems ObjectScript that loads data from stock_table_demo_two.csv into an InterSystems IRIS table</li>
	<li>stock_table_demo_one.sql: a text file containing SQL statements that can be read into the InterSystems IRIS SQL Shell. The statements create and load a 20-row table of stock trade data.</li>
	<li>stock_table_demo_two.csv: a comma-delimited file containing data for a million rows of stock trade data</li>
</ul>
